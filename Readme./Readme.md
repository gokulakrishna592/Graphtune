# Graphtune üîóüìà  
A Dynamic Graph Optimization & Tuning Framework

> Forked and extended from the original work by [lixiasky](https://github.com/lixiasky/Graphtune).  
> I am currently in the process of enhancing this project with custom analytics and dashboard integration for visual insight into graph behavior and performance.

## üß† Project Overview

**Graphtune** is a Python-based framework for optimizing and tuning graph structures using evolutionary strategies. It is built to assist in improving graph layouts and parameters for better readability, minimal edge-crossings, and improved efficiency in graph algorithms.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

- Graph parameter optimization using genetic algorithms
- Dynamic tuning of layout configurations
- Fitness evaluation metrics (e.g., edge crossings, node distance)
- Scalable across various graph sizes and types

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **NetworkX**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Scipy**
- **Pandas**
- **Graphviz**

---

## üìä Dashboard Integration (In Progress)

I am currently building a **Tableau dashboard** that connects with Graphtune‚Äôs output data to provide visual and interactive insights, including:

- üìå Graph Layout Comparisons (Before vs After Tuning)
- üìà Fitness Metrics Evolution Over Generations
- üì¶ Parameter Influence Heatmaps
- üîç Node/Edge Detail Drilldowns

### üîÑ How This Will Work:
1. **Graph data** (fitness scores, layout metrics, adjacency matrix) will be exported as `.csv` or `.json`.
2. **ETL pipeline** using Python scripts to clean and structure the output.
3. **Tableau** will connect to these files or live Python output (via TabPy) for real-time dashboarding.

## üß© Future Enhancements

- [ ] Integration with real-world graph datasets (e.g., social networks, knowledge graphs)
- [ ] Web app interface for interactive tuning (via Streamlit or Flask)
- [ ] Export optimized graphs to D3.js for web visualization
- [ ] Add CLI support for batch graph tuning jobs
